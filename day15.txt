Write a piece of code in Java to do the following:
define a 2-dimensional array (matrix) of size 3*4 and initialize it with some arbitrary values.
define a 2-dimensional array (matrix) of size 4*5 and initialize it with some arbitrary values.
write a piece of code that calculates the matrix multiplication of above ones.
print the result in console output.
If due to any reason, you don't have Java up and running, do this in JavaScript. (edited)
