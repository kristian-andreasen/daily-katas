KATA: PascalCase converter
The goal of this kata is to make use of String manipulation techniques in Java. You are given a sentence and have to convert it to PascalCase, i.e. “pineapple on pizza” -> “PineappleOnPizza”. Each word needs to be capitalized and the spaces removed.
You do not need to ask for user input, rather simply take a provided sentence and do the conversion. The sentence given is “The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog”. Convert this.
Some things to think about:
How will you handle irregular capitalization? i.e. jUmpED
How will you handle multiple whitespaces, i.e the quick     brown
How will you handle punctuation, i.e. the quick, brown! fox.
Catering for punctuation is something to do extra, but it’s not required for the kata.
A tip for the extra parts to think about is using Regular expressions with .replaceAll(regex, replaceWith);
Replace All
Regex
For these extra things to think about you can use the following sentence:
“The qUick!  bRoWn fox    jumped, OVER the    lazy. dog”
