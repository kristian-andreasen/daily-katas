Calculator:
Write a Calculator class with a method, called basicCalculator, that takes two numbers a and b and an operator o. The function should return the result of the corresponding mathematical function on both numbers. If the operator is not one of the specified characters +, -, /, *, or if there is a division by zero, the function should return null.
Look at the examples below to get an idea of what the function should do:
Examples
basicCalculator(2, '+',  4) ➞ 6

basicCalculator(6, '-', 5) ➞ 1

basicCalculator(12, '/', 3) ➞ 4

basicCalculator(3, '*', 4) ➞ 12

basicCalculator(1, '/', 0) ➞ null
// Division by zero is not possible

basicCalculator(1, 'x', 0) ➞ null
// 'x' is not an operator
Optional extension:
Add another method, called extendedCalculator, to the class. This method gets a string as input and parses it to figure out the operands and the operator. Look at the examples below:
extendedCalculator("2+ 4") ➞ 6

extendedCalculator("6 - 5") ➞ 1

extendedCalculator("12/3") ➞ 4

extendedCalculator("3*4 ") ➞ 12

extendedCalculator(" 1/ 0") ➞ null
// Division by zero is not possible

extendedCalculator("1 x 0") ➞ null
// 'x' is not an operator
Note:
Having some extra space characters in the input is not important on the result.
